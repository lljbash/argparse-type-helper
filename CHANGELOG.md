# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0]

### Added
- **Nested `@texclusive` inside `@tgroup`** — Mutually exclusive groups can now be nested inside argument groups. The exclusive constraint is created within the argument group's container, allowing fine-grained organization of related but mutually exclusive options.
- **Invalid nesting rejection** — The following nesting combinations are now rejected at decoration time with `TypeError`:
  - `@tgroup` inside `@tgroup`
  - `@tgroup` inside `@texclusive`
  - `@texclusive` inside `@texclusive`
  - Only `@texclusive` can be nested inside `@tgroup`.

## [1.0.1]

### Fixed
- Added `@dataclass_transform` to all overloads of `@tgroup` and `@texclusive` — fixes basedpyright not synthesizing field types when using these decorators
- Added generic type parameters (`[T]`) to first overloads of `@tgroup`, `@texclusive`, and `@tsubcommands` — preserves exact class type through decoration

## [1.0.0-post1]

### Added
- **`@tsubcommand(name=..., aliases=[...])`** decorator — explicitly name subcommand classes for the CLI.
  Replaces bare `@targs` on subcommand classes; `name` is required.
  `aliases` accepts a list of alternative names for the subcommand.

### Changed
- Subcommand classes **must** use `@tsubcommand(name="...")` instead of `@targs`.
  Bare `@targs` subclasses of a `@tsubcommands` base now raise `TypeError` during registration.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- **Argument groups** (`@tgroup`) — organize related arguments into named groups
- **Mutually exclusive groups** (`@texclusive`) — define arguments that cannot be used together
- **Subcommands** (`@tsubcommands`) — define subcommands via class inheritance with full type safety
- **`create_parser()`** — one-step convenience function for parser creation with auto-filled description
- **Docstring-driven help** — class/attribute docstrings automatically used as descriptions and help text
- **Smart type inference** — automatically infers `type=` from type hints (`X | None`, `Sequence[X]`, bare types)
- **`DocString`** dataclass — structured docstring parsing with title/description splitting
- **Mutable default safety** — `list`, `dict`, `set` defaults are shallow-copied to prevent sharing
- Comprehensive test suite
- Example scripts for groups (`example_groups.py`) and subcommands (`example_subcommands.py`)

### Changed
- **Internal module reorganization** — split monolithic `targs.py` and `utils.py` into focused modules:
  `_types.py`, `_decorators.py`, `_registry.py`, `_inference.py`, `_docstring.py`, `_utils.py`
- All internal modules prefixed with `_` to clearly separate public API from internals
- `register_targs` now preserves docstring formatting in help output
- Improved subclass handling and attribute copying

### Fixed
- Docstring formatting preserved in `--help` output
- Various edge cases in type inference and argument registration

## [0.2.5]

### Added
- `py.typed` marker file for PEP 561 compliance

## [0.2.4]

### Fixed
- Added `type[Action]` to `TArg.action` for custom actions

## [0.2.3]

### Fixed
- Fixed shallow copy of targs attributes when subclassing

## [0.2.2]

### Fixed
- Made `post_init` work with subclassed targs classes

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed
- Made `get_attr_docstrings` search through class hierarchy

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- `post_init` decorator for validation hooks after argument extraction

## [0.1.0]

### Changed
- Renamed package from `targs` to `argparse_type_helper`
- Initial public release on PyPI
